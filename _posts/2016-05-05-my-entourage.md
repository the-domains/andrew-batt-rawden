Orlanda Bryars is my agent/manager at Chronology Arts. She helps me get organised. She's also an awesome musician herself (voice, cello). She's moved to Australia recently from the UK, but travels quite a bit for her own music work - check it out; [www.orlandabryars.com][0]

Ben Hinchley is my technologist. He helps me by programming Max/MSP patches, Lemur patches. We're partners in crime on our "Vordenker" project. He's working in all sorts of digital media and tech. Hilariously he used to be one of my high-school composition students, and I decided I wanted to work with him then. [benjaminhinchley.com][1]

Alexander Clayton helps me by digitising my scores in Finale or Sibelius - I like to write everything by hand and often find I don't have time to do engraving myself. He's brilliant at it. He's also a composer, and is currently studying at University of Melbourne. [www.alexclaytonmusic.com][2]

# Pulsations - Plexus

## 11 May 2016, Melbourne Recital Centre

PLEXUS presents five world premieres by composers hailing from five diverse cities in a celebration of the pulsating energy that courses through the veins of modern urban life. These inspired artists, from five very different backgrounds and stylistic visions, represent a fascinating cross section of today's compositional landscape.
